## Overview and Origin
**SoFi Technologies, Inc**, is an American online personal finance company. Funded in 2011, the company started as an experiment conducted by Stanford Business School pals Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady. They were hoping to address the seriously flawed student loan system and provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. The company's inaugural loan program was a $2 million pilot at Stanford which connected 100 student borrowers with 40 Stanford alumni. Everybody won in this program,  the students received funds at a reasonable rate lower than the federal government offered, the alumni lenders collected a return on their investments, and SoFi retained a piece of the interest for their services. Over the years, the company has significanlty diversified its financial products and services to mortgages, mortgage refinancing and personal loans, the company moved away from an alumni-funded model to a non-traditional underwriting approach focused on lending to financially responsible individuals. They also offer cash management (checking) accounts and an investment platform that includes brokerage and robo-advisor services. This case study focuses on one of its segments **SoFi Money<sup>TM</sup>**.

## Business Activities:
### Financial problems trying to solve
Since its inception as a student-loan platform, SoFi has set its sights on becoming a one-stop shop when you need a loan, or want a savings account, or need to start investing in the stock market. There’s no shortage of financial institutions that already do the same thing. The question is whether SoFi can do it better. SoFi positions itself as the only company offering a suite of varied financial services in one place.
### Target customers
SoFi’s target customers are those it calls “high earners not well-served,” or people who have taken out financial offerings from multiple banks. The company has won over 2 millions millennial and Gen-Z customers.
### Competitions  
**SoFi Money<sup>TM</sup>** faces increasing competition across product lines from neobanks and incumbents. SoFi's “one-stop-shop” financial service is a significant competitive advantage over neobank competitors who tend to focus on niche offerings rather than the full financial picture. The seamlessly different products cross-selling flatform enable the company to increase its customers’ Lifetime Value (LTV) and reducing its Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC). 

Compare to the incumbents, it’s an online financial services flatform that doesn’t have any of the costs associated with staffing or maintaining branches. That branchless beginning also helps underscore it appeal to millennials and the Gen Z in today’s era of unprecedented convenience and speed.  
### Technologies
Sofi uses Galileo’s HTTP APIs provide customers the most advanced experience in creating and managing accounts, authorizing payments, managing card balances and getting fraud protection. 

Sofi also collaborated with AI-powered credit and analysis technology company Pagaya to help more eligible consumers find and secure financing. Using both AI and machine learning, SoFi lowers risk for lenders and helps them make better credit decisions. SoFi also use machine learning to identify new customers and to learn which ancillary products it should recommend to existing customers. SoFi’s data science team mines large datasets and runs various regression techniques to tease out the relationship, if any, between attributes in those datasets and credit worthiness.

Some of the following core metrics that companies in online banking domain are used to measure success:
1. Acquisition Metrics
2. Activation Metrics
3. Retention Metrics
4. Referrals
5. Revenues
6. Marketing Metrics
7. Technical Metrics

According to *SoFi Technologies Reports Trird Quarter 2021 Rusults*, the company's performance is well. The total Year-over-Year Member Growth of 96% to 2.9 Million. By iterating on referrals, continuing to scale top of the funnel products, SoFi Money bundle to 100% of their members. The 178% year-over-year increase in SoFi Money is the large driver of the increase in total Financial Servies products. 

In 2020, SoFi reported a net revenue of 621 million, but the finanacial segment only accounted for less than 20% of that.   Compare to its biggest competitor, Chime, which generated $600 million revenue in 2020, and has over 13 million customers, SoFi still has many challenges ahead. 
## Recommendations
I would recommend SoFi to add a payment feature integrated into the SoFi app. The customers can complete payment quickly with smartphones. By online and QR code payment system, consumers can send money to their friends, pay for goods and services online and offline, pay for a cab, pay in restaurants, pay for tickets and hotels and much more. 

If SoFi can provide an app with a payment feature and collaborate with other commerce business, the company’s market size will be greatly expanded. 

By using the open-source technology QR Code API and other in-app APIs for iOS and Android, SoFi enable its customers to make payment through SoFi app.

The QR Code technology is appropriate for SoFi in-app payment. When SoFi members sign up for an account with the app, SoFi will create a QR code. If the vendor also uses SoFi app, the customer will get info about the product and about the payment by scanning vendor’s QR code and easily complete the payment in a second.
